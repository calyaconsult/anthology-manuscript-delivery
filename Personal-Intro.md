THE AESTHETICS OF AI-WRITTEN TEXTS

HOW THIS ANTHOLOGY EVOLVED

My interest in machine-generated texts goes back a long way. As a first-year student, I read Max Bense’s seminal book Einführung in die informationstheoretische Ästhetik: Grundlegung und Anwendung in der Texttheorie (1971). Bense cites, among others, “Stochastische Texte” by Theo Lutz. They made a huge impression on me. And, as soon as I had my first computer, I tried to emulate this method of text production.

In the 1990s, I read books about LISP and learned programming in PROLOG. Both languages were then considered essential for studying Artificial Intelligence. My biggest success in PROLOG was a program that could derive the name of the metre from the sequence of syllables of a verse. It was then, in the early 1990s, that I gave a short talk on rule-based text generation that ended with the prediction: one day computers will be able to write whole stories without human intervention.

That day has arrived. In early 2022, a friend asked me if it would be possible to generate a blog post with AI. I tried a few text-completion algorithms, but the results were too weird for serious blogging. Then, in November 2022, OpenAI released GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT), and the world of machine writing changed in a fundamental way: for the first time it was possible to generate texts that were more than experiments for nerds.

ChatGPT triggered a worldwide hype. Suddenly everybody talked about AI. And nearly everybody used it. But, from day one, there was a sharp divide: people who welcomed ChatGPT as the forerunner of an AGI or even ASI that would make life easier for everybody, if not bring paradise on Earth, and people who saw in the chatbot a harbinger of doom. The divide persists to the present day.

Criticism of AI has many important points to make:
- Training Large Language Models requires enormous amounts of electrical energy.
- The data used in training current models were collected without asking copyright owners for permission.
- Only a few states (the USA, China, the UAE) and a very limited number of companies (Google, Amazon, Meta, xAI, OpenAI, Anthropic, Moonshot AI, High-Flyer) have the money and know-how needed to play in the first league of AI research and development.
- Large Language Models reproduce biases common on the internet.
- English is by far the dominant language on the internet and thus is overrepresented in AI training data.
- AI is a threat to millions of jobs.
- AI is used to flood the internet with fake news, and AI bots are the nemesis of social media.
- The military use of AI will have disastrous consequences.
- AGI and then ASI might develop into an existential threat for humanity.
- The use of AI tools makes people lazy and, over time, leads to a deterioration of their mental capacities.
- If children or students are granted access to AI tools, this will hinder their mental and intellectual development.
- People use AI for guidance, but AI doesn’t know right from wrong or truth from falsehood.
- AI is not a person, but there are people who enter into an emotional relationship with a chatbot.

None of these objections to AI is without merit, and every single one of them needs to be addressed if AI is to be beneficial for all of humanity.

There is one argument, however, that is often brought forward and which I think is without merit:
- AI is a bad writer.

On the contrary: AI is an excellent writer. In fact, it writes better than most of us. From its enormous corpus of training data, it has learned many of the rules, finer points, and intricacies of human language—not only one language but many. It is capable of writing in English, German, French, Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Japanese, Mandarin, Korean, Vietnamese, and so on and so forth. True: AI is not particularly good at Mohawk, Navajo, Quechua, Uzbek, Kazakh, Tamazight, or many languages from south of the Sahara. But in many cases, as with te reo Māori, the Indigenous language of Aotearoa (New Zealand), efforts are being made to close the gap, and the day is not far when AI will be able to understand and write/speak in any language a user might want to converse in.

With an AI chatbot you can even chat in Latin, Ancient Greek, Ottoman Turkish or—maybe at some point in the future—Aztec or Akkadian.

So the situation we face today (early 2026) is that humans have a rival in the arena of language. Not many people are fully aware that this is the case, but a great many can feel it. For me, this explains, to a certain degree, why the claim “AI is a bad writer” is so popular.

### What has all this got to do with our anthology of machine-written texts?

Soon after GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) came out, I started using the chatbot not only for business but also as a writing assistant. In most cases, its role was to help me brainstorm ideas for a story, draft plots, and explore genre conventions. In some cases, I let it write a sample chapter or another short piece of prose. Over the last three years, my collection of ideas, plot outlines, and sample texts has grown, and I started thinking about publishing the whole thing under the heading “Unfinished Texts.”

In the last few months, however, I've had a lot of discussions with friends and colleagues who all use AI for business and personal writing, and one topic kept popping up again and again: most people haven’t got the slightest clue what’s coming. We are in year 4 after ChatGPT, and large language models are already writing like highly trained humans. This will have a profound impact on how we look at texts and how we judge their quality. Being able to write fluent, even elegant, prose will no longer be the hallmark of the writer but of the machine. Then what?

This anthology is not meant to accuse or defend. It presents texts generated by large language models “as is,” without human intervention other than the prompt that initiates their generation. The output will be presented raw and unedited. It is up to the reader to find errors, inconsistencies, strange artifacts (such as Chinese ideograms in an English sentence), overused em dashes, and more.

But first and foremost, it is meant to explore the current state of machine writing. Let us inspect these texts that have no author, no intent, no message, no soul, yet still succeed in eliciting in the reader what Roland Barthes calls “le plaisir du texte.”

### Constraints

Machine-generated texts are swamping the internet and social media. As a rule, they tend to conceal their origins and masquerade as products of genuine human effort. The sheer number of these texts, and the difficulty of identifying them, make it impossible to obtain a representative sample. But we are not statisticians; we are readers who enjoy well-written prose.

This anthology therefore presents texts that belong to the broad category of fiction. To focus on factors such as fluency, style, grammatical correctness, and other linguistic features, we limited the corpus to texts in English and excluded both texts in other languages and translations. A second anthology featuring texts in languages beyond English is in the early stages of planning.
