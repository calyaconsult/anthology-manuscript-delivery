THE AESTHETICS OF AI-WRITTEN TEXTS

HOW THIS ANTHOLOGY EVOLVED

My interest in machine-generated texts goes back a long way. As a first-yeare student, I read Max Benses seminal book "Einführung in die informationstheoretische Aesthetik: Grundlegung und Anwendung in der Texttheorie" (1971) Bense cites, among others, "Stochastische Texte" by Theo Lutz. They made a huge impression on me. And, as soon as I had my first computer, I tried to emulate this method of text production.

In the 1990s, I read books about LISP and learned programming in PROLOG. Both languages were then considered essential for studying Artificial Intelligence. My biggest success in PROLOG was a program that could derive the name of the metre from the sequence of syllables of a verse. It was then, in the early 1990s that I gave a short talk on rule-based text generation that ended with the prediction: one day computers will be able to write whole stories without human intervention.

That day has arrived. In early 2022, a friend asked me if it would be possible to generate a blog post with AI. I tried a few text completion algorithms but the results were too weird for serious blogging. Then, in Novewmber 2022, OpenAI released GPT-3.5 (ChatGPT) and the world of machine writing changed in a fundamental way: for the first time it was possible to generate texts that were more that experiments for nerds.

ChatGPT triggered a world-wide hype. Suddenly everybody talked about AI. And nearly everybody used it. But, from day one, there was a sharp divide: people who welcomed ChatGPT as the forerunner of an AGI or even ASI that would make life easier for everybody if not bring Paradise on Earth, and people who saw in the chatbot a harbinger of Doom. The divide persists to the present day.

Criticism of AI has many important points to make:
- Training Large Language Models requires enormous amounts of electrical energy.
- The data used in the training of the current models were collected without asking copyright owners for permission.
- Only a few states (the USA, China, the UAE) and a very limited number of companies (Google, Amazon, Meta, xAI, OpenAI, Anthropic, Moonshot AI, High-Flyer) have the money and know-how needed to play in the first league of AI research and development.
- Large Language Models reproduce biases common on the internet.
- English is by far the dominant language on the internet and thus is overrepresented in AI training data.
- AI is a threat to millions of jobs
- AI is used to flood the internet with fake news, and AI bots are the nemesis of Social Media
- The military use of AI will have disastrous consequences
- AGI and then ASI might develop into an existential threat for humanity
- The use of AI tools makes people lazy and, over time, leads to a deterioration of their mental capacities
- If children or students are granted access to AI tools this will hinder their mental and intellectual development
- People use AI for guidance but AI doesn't know right from wrong or truth from falsehood.
- AI is not a person but there are people who enter into an emotional relationship with a chatbot.

None of these objections against AI is without merit and every single one of them needs to be addressed if AI is to be beneficial for all of humanity.

There is one argument, however, which is often brought forward and which I think is without merit:
- AI is a bad writer.

On the contrary: AI is an excellent writer. In fact it writes better than most of us. From its enourmous corpus of traing data, it has learned all the rules, all the finer points and all the intricacies of human language. And not only one language but many languages. It is capable of writing in English, German, French, Spanish, Turkish, Arabic, Urdu, Hindi, Japanese, Mandarin, Korean, Vietnamese and so on and so forth. True: AI is not particularly good at Mowhawk, Navajo, Quechua, Uzbek, Kazakh, Tamazight or African languages from south of the Sahara. But in many cases, like with *te reo Māori*, the original language of Aotearoa (New Zealand), efforts are being made to close the gap, and so the day is not far when AI will be able to understand and write/speak in any language a user might want to converse in.

With an AI chatbot you can even chat in Latin, Ancient Greek, Ottoman Turkish or, maybe at some point in the future Aztek or Accadian.

So the situation we face today (early 2026) is that humans have a rival in the arena of language. Not many people are quite aware that this is the case but a great many can feel it. For me this explains, to a certain degree, why the claim "AI is a bad writer" is so popular.

What has all this got to do with our anthology of machine-written texts?

This anthology is not meant to accuse or defend. It presents texts generated by Large Language Models "as is" without human intervention other than the prompt that initiates the generation of a text. The output will be presented raw and unedited. It is up to the reader to find errors, inconsistzencies, strange artifacts (like, for instance, Chinese ideograms in an English sentence), overused em dashes, and more.

In order to focus on parameters like fluency of expression, levels of style, correctness of grammer and other linguistic features, we decided to limit the corpus of texts to texts in English only and to exclude texts in other languages as well as translations from other languages. A second anthology with texts in non-English languages is in the early stages of planning.
