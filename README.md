# Synthetic Texts

"Synthetic Texts" is an anthology project documenting the preparation and collection of machine-generated texts. This repository serves as a central hub for managing the manuscript preparation process, providing an audit trail for the development of both machine-generated and human-written components.

## Project Overview

The project explores the capabilities of modern AI language models in text production, as detailed in the [Anthology Introduction](Anthology-Intro.md). While the machine-generated texts themselves are not protected by copyright, the human-written texts, including the curation and introductory materials, are protected.

## Repository Purpose

This repository is used for:
- Documenting the manuscript preparation process.
- Providing a permanent, time-stamped record of submissions ([Why we use GitHub](Why-we-use-GitHub.md)).
- Managing the list of texts under consideration.
- Establishing protocols for manuscript delivery.
