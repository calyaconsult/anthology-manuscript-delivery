# Why We Use GitHub: A Simple Explanation

Think of GitHub as a **super-secure, time-stamped diary for your document**. It’s not just a place to store files; it’s a tool that automatically records everything that happens to them.

Here is why we use it to create an "audit trail" (a fancy term for a trustworthy history):

**1. It’s an Automatic Time Machine**
Every time you upload a file or make a change, GitHub takes a snapshot. It permanently records **what** was done, **who** did it, and—most importantly—the **exact date and time** it happened (using an official server clock). You don’t have to do anything; it happens automatically.

**2. It Proves Your Work Existed at a Certain Time**
Because the timestamp comes from GitHub’s servers (not your personal computer’s clock, which you could change), it creates a credible, third-party record. If you ever need to prove that you had a draft finished by a specific deadline, this record serves as your official proof.

**3. Nothing is Ever Truly Lost**
Even if a file is deleted or changed, the old versions don't vanish. They are safely stored in the project's history. You can think of it as an unlimited "undo" button that we can use to look back at exactly how the document looked at any point in time.

In short, we use GitHub to create a permanent, trustworthy, and automatic record of your document's life from the moment it's first uploaded.
